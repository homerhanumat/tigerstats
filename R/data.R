#' 
#' Attitudes Survey
#' 
#' Crime: You are on a jury for a manslaughter case in Lewistown, PA.  The
#' defendant has been found guilty, and in Pennsylvania it is part of the job
#' of the jury to recommend a sentence to the judge.  The facts of the case are
#' as follows.  The defendant, Tyrone Marcus Watson, a 35-year old native of
#' Lewistown, was driving under the influence of alcohol on the evening of
#' Tuesday July 17, 2001.  At approximately 11:00 PM Watson drove through a red
#' light, striking a pedestrian, Betsy Brockenheimer, a 20-year old resident of
#' Lewistown.  Brockenheimer was taken unconscious to the hospital and died of
#' her injuries about one hour later.  Watson did not flee the scene, nor did
#' he resist arrest.
#' 
#' The prior police record for Mr. Watson is as follows: two minor traffic
#' violations, and one previous arrest, five years ago, for DUI.  No one was
#' hurt in that incident.
#' 
#' Watson has now been convicted of DUI and manslaughter.  The minimum jail
#' term for this combination of offenses is two years; the maximum term is
#' fifty years.  In the blank below, write a number from 2 to 50 as your
#' recommended length of sentence for Tyrone Marcus Watson.  _______________
#' 
#' [In the question above, name of defendant could vary: either William Shane
#' Winchester or Tyrone Marcus Watson.  The name of the victim could also vary:
#' either Betsy Brockenheimer or Latisha Dawes.]
#' 
#' Spending Habits
#' 
#' You have purchased a $30 ticket to see a rock concert in Rupp Arena.  When
#' you arrive at the Arena on the night of the performance, you find that you
#' have lost the ticket.  You have no receipt, so it will not be possible to
#' see the concert unless you purchase another ticket.  Would you purchase
#' another ticket?  Circle below.
#' 
#' YES NO
#' 
#' [In other forms, the question above could have been: You plan to see a rock
#' concert in Rupp Arena.  Tickets for the performance are $30. When you arrive
#' at the Arena on the night of the performance, you find that you have lost
#' two bills from your purse or wallet: a ten and a twenty.  Would you buy the
#' ticket anyway?]

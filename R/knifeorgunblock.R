#' Knife or Gun?
#' 
#' What will make you yell louder: being killed with a knife or being killed
#' with a gun?  Results of an entirely imaginary experiment performed on very
#' strange volunteers.  Members of the Knife group are killed by a knife, and
#' members of the Gun group are killed by a gun. The volume of the screams of each
#' subject during slaying is recorded.  In order to ensure that the two groups
#' are similar with respect to how loud they can yell in the first place,
#' subjects are blocked by whether or not they have participated in
#' hog-hollering contests.  After blocking, subjects are randomly assigned to
#' groups.

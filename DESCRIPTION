Description: This package consists of datasets and functions that are useful
    in the teaching of statistics at an elementary level to students who may
    have little or no previous experience with the command line.  The functions
    for elementary inferential procedures follow a uniform interface for user
    input. The package is typically used with package mosaic but runs
    independently of it.  Some of the functions are instructional applets that
    can only be run on the RStudio IDE with RStudio's package manipulate
    loaded. The RStudio IDE is freely available (www.rstudio.org), and includes
    package manipulate.

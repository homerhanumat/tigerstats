Attitudes Survey

Crime: You are on a jury for a manslaughter case in Lewistown, PA.  The
defendant has been found guilty, and in Pennsylvania it is part of the job
of the jury to recommend a sentence to the judge.  The facts of the case are
as follows.  The defendant, Tyrone Marcus Watson, a 35-year old native of
Lewistown, was driving under the influence of alcohol on the evening of
Tuesday July 17, 2001.  At approximately 11:00 PM Watson drove through a red
light, striking a pedestrian, Betsy Brockenheimer, a 20-year old resident of
Lewistown.  Brockenheimer was taken unconscious to the hospital and died of
her injuries about one hour later.  Watson did not flee the scene, nor did
he resist arrest.

The prior police record for Mr. Watson is as follows: two minor traffic
violations, and one previous arrest, five years ago, for DUI.  No one was
hurt in that incident.

Watson has now been convicted of DUI and manslaughter.  The minimum jail
term for this combination of offenses is two years; the maximum term is
fifty years.  In the blank below, write a number from 2 to 50 as your
recommended length of sentence for Tyrone Marcus Watson.  _______________

[In the question above, name of defendant could vary: either William Shane
Winchester or Tyrone Marcus Watson.  The name of the victim could also vary:
either Betsy Brockenheimer or Latisha Dawes.]

Spending Habits

You have purchased a $30 ticket to see a rock concert in Rupp Arena.  When
you arrive at the Arena on the night of the performance, you find that you
have lost the ticket.  You have no receipt, so it will not be possible to
see the concert unless you purchase another ticket.  Would you purchase
another ticket?  Circle below.

YES NO

[In other forms, the question above could have been: You plan to see a rock
concert in Rupp Arena.  Tickets for the performance are $30. When you arrive
at the Arena on the night of the performance, you find that you have lost
two bills from your purse or wallet: a ten and a twenty.  Would you buy the
ticket anyway?]

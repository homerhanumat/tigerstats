\title{Chi Square Resampler (One at a Time)}
\usage{
ChisqSimSlow(form,data,effects=c("random","fixed"))
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{a formula of the form ~x+y.  When using
fixed effects (see below for explanation), x should be the
variable that is considered the predictor variable.}

\item{data}{A data frame from which x and y are drawn.}

\item{effects}{When effects="fixed", the resampling is performed under
the conditon that the row sums in the resampled two-way table (with x
for rows) are the same as the row sums in the twoway table based on the
original data.  When effects="random", then both row and column sums
in the resampled table may vary: only the sum of the counts is
constant.  (Note:  in the resampling procedure for chisq.test
in the stats package of R, both row and column sums are
required to equal the corresponding sums for the original data.)}

\description{
An app to illustrate use of the chi-square statistic to test
for a relationship between two categorical variables.  The P-value is computed
by resampling, and the resamples are done one at a time.  A histogram of resampled chi-square statistics is displayed
after each resample, and summary information is output to the
console.

\description{
A dataset recreated from summary data describing the relationship between weather and crowd behavior during 21 recorded  
incidents in England, in which a (suicidal) person was contemplating jumping from a ledge or other high structure and a crowd 
gathered to watch.  The variables are as follows:

\itemize{
  \item weather. Warm or cool, based on the time of year when the incident occurred.  
  \item crowd.behavior. The crowd either baited the would-be jumper, or was polite.

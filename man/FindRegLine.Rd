\usage{
FindRegLine
}
\value{
Graphical and numerical output.

\description{
The regression minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS).  In this 
game, the player chooses slope and y-intercept
of a line so as to approximate the regression line.  The move-able 
line is set initially as a horizontal line with height equal to
the mean of the y-coordinates of the scatter plot, so initially 
the residual sum of squares equals the total sum of squares (TSS).
The player's score is the sum of the number of turns taken and the 
difference between the current RSS
and the regression line's RSS (as a percentage of  TSS-RSS for regression 
line).  The aim is to lower one's score.

\usage{
proptestGC(x,data=parent.frame(),n=numeric(),p=NULL,
                         alternative=c("two.sided","less","greater"),
                         success="yes",first=NULL,conf.level=0.95,
                         correct=TRUE,graph=FALSE,verbose=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a formula or a numeric vector.  If formula, it must be of the form ~x
indicating the single variable under study, or of the form ~x+y, in which case x is the explanatory grouping variable
(categorical with two values) and y is the response categorical variable with two values.
When summary data are provided, x is a numeric vector of success counts.}

\item{data}{Data frame that supplies the variables x and y.  If any are not in data, then they will be
searched for in the parent environment.}

\item{n}{When not empty, this is a numeric vector giving the size of each sample.}

\item{p}{Specifies Null Hypothesis value for population proportion.  If not set, no test is performed.}

\item{alternative}{"two.sided" requests computation of a two-sided P-value;  other possible values are "less" and "greater".}

\item{success}{When x is a formula, this argument indicates which value of variable x (in case of ~x) or y (in case of ~x+y)
is being counted as a success.  When working
with formula-data input the value of this parameter MUST be set, even when the variable has only
two values.}

\item{first}{When performing 2-sample procedures, this argument specifies which value of
the explanatory variable constitutes the first group.}

\item{conf.level}{Number between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence-level of the interval supplied.}

\item{correct}{Applies continuity correction for one-proportion procedures.  It is ignored when
when 2-proportions are performed.}

\item{graph}{If TRUE, plot graph of P-value.}

\item{verbose}{Indicates how much output goes to the console}
}
\value{
A list, either of class "gcp1test" (one-proportion) or "gcp2test" (two proportions).  
Components of this list that may be usefully queried include:  "statistic", "p.value", and "interval".
}
\description{
Employs the normal approximation to perform test for one or two proportions.
}
\examples{
data(m111survey)
#2-proportions, formula-data input, 95\%-confidence interval only:
proptestGC(~sex+seat,data=m111survey,success="2_middle")

#For other confidence levels, use argument conf.level.  For 90\%-interval for one proportion p:
proptestGC(~sex,data=m111survey,success="male",conf.level=0.90)

#one proportion, formula-data input, confidence interval and two-sided test with H_0:  p = 0.33:
proptestGC(~seat,data=m111survey,success="1_front",p=0.33)

#Summary data:
#In first sample, 23 successes out of 100 trials.  In second sample, 33 out of 110.
proptestGC(x=c(23,33),n=c(100,110))

#Summary data:
#In one sample, 40 successes in 100 trials.  Testing whether p = 0.45.
proptestGC(x=40,n=100,p=0.45,correct=TRUE)

#Want less output?  Set argument verbose to FALSE:
proptestGC(~sex+seat,data=m111survey,success="2_middle",p=0.33,verbose=FALSE)

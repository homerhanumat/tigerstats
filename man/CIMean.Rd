\description{
An app to investigate how sample size and confidence level affect the width of a confidence interval.  
A sample is drawn from the input population and a confidence interval for
the population mean is calculated.  The kernel density plot for the population
and the histogram for each new sample are plotted, along with the confidence
interval.  Summary information is output to the console to tally the number of times
the computed confidence interval covers the true population mean and how many times
it misses.  There is an option to draw 100 or 1000 samples at a time.

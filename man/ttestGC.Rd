\usage{
ttestGC(x=NULL,data=parent.frame(),mean=numeric(),sd=numeric(),n=numeric(),
 mu=NULL,alternative=c("two.sided","less","greater"),var.equal=FALSE,
 conf.level=0.95,graph=FALSE,first=NULL,verbose=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{If not NULL, then must be a formula.  If a formula, then data must be a dataframe.
For one sample t-procedures, x is of the form ~var.  For two-sample procedures,
x is of the form resp~exp, where exp is factor with two values.  If x is of form ~var1-var2,
then matched pairs procedures are performed.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing variables in formula x.  If some variables are not in data,
then they are searched for in the parent environment.}

\item{mean}{When not NULL, contains sample mean(s).  Length 1 for one sample t-procedures,
Length 2 for two-sample procedures.}

\item{sd}{When not NULL, contains sample standard deviation(s).}

\item{n}{When not NULL, contains sample size(s).}

\item{mu}{Contains the null value for the parameter of interest.  If not set, no test is performed.}

\item{alternative}{"two.sided" requests computation of a two-sided P-value;  other possible values 
are "less" and "greater".}

\item{var.equal}{When FALSE, use Welch's approximation to the degrees of freedom.}

\item{conf.level}{Number between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence-level of the interval supplied.}

\item{graph}{If TRUE, plot graph of P-value.}

\item{first}{If assigned, gives the value of the explanatory variable that is to count
as the first sample.}

\item{verbose}{Indicate how much output goes to console}
}
\value{
A list of class "GCttest" Components of the list that may be usefully 
queried include:  "statistic", "p.value", and "interval".
}
\description{
t-tests and confidence intervals for one and two samples.
}
\examples{
#One-sample t, 95\%-confidence interval only:
ttestGC(~fastest,data=m111survey)

#For other confidence levels, set argument conf.level as desired.  For 90\%-interval:
ttestGC(~fastest,data=m111survey,conf.level=0.90)

# One-sample t, 95\%-confidence interval and two-sided test with H_0:  mu = 100:
ttestGC(~fastest,data=m111survey,mu=100)

#Two-sample t, 95\%-confidence interval only:
ttestGC(fastest~sex,data=m111survey)

#control order of groups with argument first:
ttestGC(fastest~sex,data=m111survey,first="male")

# Matched pairs, confidence interval with one-sided test, H_0: mu-d = 0:
ttestGC(~ideal_ht-height,data=m111survey,mu=0,alternative="greater")

#Summary data, one sample, one-sided test with H_0:  mu = 52.5:
ttestGC(mean=55,sd=4,n=16,mu=52.5,alternative="greater")

#Summary data, two samples:
ttestGC(mean=c(50,55),sd=c(3,4),n=c(25,40),mu=0)

\title{Distribution of the Difference of Sample Means}
\usage{
SampDist2Means(pop,max.samp.sizes=50,sim.reps=1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{A data frame representing the population from which samples are taken.}

\item{max.samp.sizes}{Largest sample sizes shown on the sliders.}

\item{sim.reps}{Number of simulation repetitions to construct empirical distribution of difference of sample
means.}
}
\value{
Graphical and numerical output.
}
\description{
An app to explore the Central Limit Theorem in the context of the difference of sample means.
}
\note{
Uses \code{manipulate} in R Studio.  Also requires package \code{lattice}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data(imagpop)
if (require(manipulate)) SampDist2Means(imagpop)
}
